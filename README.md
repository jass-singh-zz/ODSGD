# ODSGD

Object Detection and Smudging using Gradient Descent

*Digital Single-Lens Reflex image editing is strenuous both on front of software and human. This project implements the idea of making the picture to seem as it has been taken from DSLR without using any specific DSLR image editing software.*

This repository contains code for GUI and screenshots reagarding working of project.
It includes sample input and output (*images with applied Smudgy effect*) images.
